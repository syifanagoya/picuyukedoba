The 46-year-old Jimmy Kimmel Live! host and his wife,<strong> Molly McNearney</strong>, are expecting a baby. Kimmel shared the exciting news during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, airing Wednesday, Feb. 26.</p><p>“I’m having a baby . . . wait I want to finish . . . with Ellen,” the late night host jokingly announced. “No, I decided to have the first one with my wife. We got married in July and, you know, it’s interesting. It’s disgusting the way babies are made.”</p><p>“Good for you,” host <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a> </strong>said. “And why is it disgusting?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Well, there are so many human body parts involved,” Kimmel quipped. “Did you know there are eggs in us? That’s gross just to start with.”</p><p>The comedian wed longtime love McNearney, a co-head writer on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, in July 2013. Kimmel is already dad to daughter Katie and son Kevin with ex-wife Gina, whom he divorced in 2002.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I don’t know where they are, but I hear they’re doing great,” Kimmel joked of his eldest children. “No, I have a 20-year-old son and a 22-year-old daughter, and I’ve really forgotten everything. It’s funny because I was just with some friends who just had a baby, I was like, ‘Oh yeah.’ And there’s new ways to do things. You hold them by the front of the neck now it seems,” he quipped.</p><p>The friends Kimmel was referring to are celebrity pals <a href=#><strong>John Krasinski</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Emily Blunt</strong></a>, who <a href=#>welcomed their first child</a>, daughter Hazel, earlier this month. “John holds the baby by the front of the face, and they say this is a good thing,” Kimmel said. “And he tried it on me and it felt good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The soon-to-be dad of three said he’d like to wait to find out the gender, but wife McNearney wants to know. “I would like it to be a surprise and my wife, Molly, was happy with that idea until about a week ago she started saying we really need to find out,” he explained. “But I don’t think it matters. I don’t think you need to make the baby’s room blue or pink I mean it’s kind of – it’s inherently ridiculous. I don’t think they could even see colors, right? I mean, or is that dogs I’m thinking of?”</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Pregnancy confessions</a></p><p>As for baby names, Kimmel joked that, depending on the sex, “Karate or The Riddler are the names we’re thinking of right now.” He’s also “very excited” about an idea for the baby’s middle name. “I would like the baby’s middle name to be Effin,” he revealed. “And not the curse version of it, like e-f-f-i-n. Like Ellen Effin DeGeneres. I mean, what a great name. Right?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKGipZ2ueqy1zKacpWWVrb2mr9OipaBlkpavunnWoquhZaees6Z5zKijpbFdorCvscCrpZ6xXWd9coCRbWk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
