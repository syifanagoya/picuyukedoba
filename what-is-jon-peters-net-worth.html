Peters gained this mammoth net worth by becoming a multi-award-winning producer over 30 years. He also managed Barbara Streisand’s early music and film career during the 1970s. Before becoming Hollywood’s most prominent movie producer, Californian-born Peters worked as a stylist in a family salon on Rodeo Drive. During this time, he dated Barbra Streisand after he designed a short wig for her for the 1974 film, For Pete’s Sake. Along with the relationship came the birth of a perfect working partnership. Peter produced Streisand’s 1974 album, Butterfly, and co-produced (with Streisand) the revamped version of A Star is Born. The 1976 film made over $100 million at the box office and received four Oscar nominations. Peters went on to produce a string of hits for Streisand’s award-winning albums.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Now a fully-blossomed producer, Peters teamed up with movie producer, Peter Guber in 1980, and formed Polygram Productions (later renamed Boardwalk Company.) along with Neil Bogart. Three years later, the Guber-Peters Company was born. Together they produced a string of blockbusters, including Flashdance, The Color Purple, Witches of Eastwick, Rain Man, and Batman. The company rapidly grew in size as Guber-Peter went into partnership with Chuck Barris Production, which was known as Guber-Peters-Barris. The newly-formed company made their most successful production, Batman (1989), which earned them a multi-million dollar contract with Warner Bros. However there was a better offer: Sony Pictures offered the duo one billion dollars to become the company’s chief executive – which they accepted. After two years at Sony, Peters left to form Peters Entertainment which produced blockbusters including Batman Returns, Wild, Wild West, Ali, and Superman Returns. Peters received multiple Oscars, Golden and Grammys plus over 250 nominations. Peters Entertainment’s overall income is estimated to be over 6 billion dollars.</p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Discover How Much Money Disneyland Makes a Day | In-depth Analysis"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":513,"3":{"1":0},"12":0}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/discover-how-much-money-disneyland-makes-a-day-in-depth-analysis/ data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/discover-how-much-money-disneyland-makes-a-day-in-depth-analysis/"}{"1":77}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Discover How Much Money Disneyland Makes a Day | In-depth Analysis</a></span><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Richest Businessmen</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>What Is Tom Anderson Net Worth?</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>John Daly Bio: Career, Net Worth & Personal Life</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfrLWiwIyiqmain6N6sbHTnqmsZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
