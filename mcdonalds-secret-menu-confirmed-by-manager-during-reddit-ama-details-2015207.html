An anonymous restaurant manager at global fast-food chain McDonald’s revealed via a <a href=#>Reddit AMA</a> this past weekend that a secret menu exists.</p><p>“IamA McDonald’s manager AMA!” the subject of the Ask Me Anything reads, with the following blurb: “Have you ever wondered exactly how your fast food is made? Or what it’s like to work for one of the biggest food giants in the world? I’ve been working for McDonald’s for 3 years throughout college/Uni and now that I’ve graduated.. still working for McDonald’s as a manager.”</p><p>The manager, <a href=#>OrchidHibiscus</a>, who supposedly works at a Glasgow, Scotland, location, shared some pointers with fast-food fans about ordering off the alternative menu.</p><p>“Order one and the workers might not know it by name … but if you explain what it is, and are willing to pay for all the ingredients, it’s just another ‘grill order’ that we can make up,” the employee said in response to one user.</p><p><a href=#>Hack the Menu</a>, which collects secret menus from different restaurants, has a complete list of McDonald’s offerings, including a Chicken McGriddle; Big McChicken; Land, Sea, and Air Burger; McCrepe; and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“The items on the ‘secret menu’ weren’t invented by anyone officially at McDonald’s,” the manager wrote via Reddit. “It’s just a random person’s guide to burgers you could potentially ‘hack’ at McDonald’s.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The most interesting menu items via <a href=#>Hack the Menu</a> include the McGangbang, a McChicken sandwich enclosed within a McDouble, offered for $2. Another popular secret menu item is the Monster Mac, a burger that includes eight beef patties and costs $6.49. In order to get the Monster Mac, a customer simply has to request eight (or fewer or more!) patties inside their Big Mac.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The phrasing of “secret menu,” however, is not something McDonald’s wishes to confirm. “We do not have a secret menu at McDonald’s UK,” the chain told <a href=#>Mashable</a> in a statement on Monday. “That’s because we love the food that we serve in our restaurants and we don’t want to keep it a secret from our customers.”</p><p>However, the fast-food franchise confirmed that customers’ requests for changes to menu options would be honored. “Any requests for extra items or changes to our products are considered at the restaurant manager’s discretion and any additional items may be charged for,” the rep told the site.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKScnJ%2Bjrq2w0maqnpuimsFuucSnrGabn6Ozqr7MnptmmqliuqK6wKCcq2WUqr%2BqusZmqZ6clJ7Bbq3MmmSdnaSWtq2%2FjGtnam1iZYQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
