Another problem, Nathan doesn't have the rights to display the Ocean Spray logo, so that will have to be digitally blurred.</p><p>Even with these alterations, Doggface is hoping to list the NFT with an opening bid of $500,000.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-317680 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GettyImages-1139187710.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-317680 class=wp-caption-text>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images</p><p>That might seem like a lot, but NFTs are booming lately and no one can really say what any particular piece might be worth, as investors and collectors seem to be gripped by a fever that causes them to spend millions of dollars on the digital objects. NFTs use the blockchain to serve as a one-of-a-kind token that can't be directly exchanged for cash but can be traded like a painting or any other collectible, and it seems that a lot of people with any kind of public notoriety are attempting to capitalize on the trend.</p><p>Nicks wasn't interested in being involved int he sale, even after being offered half the proceeds of the sale. Doggface says he's insulted by the move, since (as he sees it) his video was responsible for a big spike in Fleetwood Mac's popularity among a younger audience, many of whom discovered their music for the first time through the video.</p><p>With no music and no Ocean Spray logo, it remains to be seen whether Doggface's NFT will find a buyer for that $500,000 starting bid. But if it does, Doggface can be proud of establishing such a high value for his own work without the help of Fleetwood Mac â€“ and maybe Stevie Nicks will regret missing out on such an easy payday.</p><p>As of this writing, the NFT sale has still not occurred.</p><h2><strong>How much money has Nathan Apodaca made off his viral TikTok?</strong></h2><p>At the time he filmed the TikTok, Nathan was living at his brother's house. He had previously been living in modest RV parked in a Walmart parking lot. He had less than $200 to his name when he rode the skateboard to his job at a potato warehouse.</p><p>Using donations from fans, in November 2020 he was able to purchase a 5-bedroom home in Idaho Falls, Idaho. The home had recently been listed for sale for $320,000.</p><p>Ocean Spray gifted Nathan a new cranberry-color Nissan truck full of bottles of Cran-Raspberry. Nathan subequently traded the Nissan for a Chevy Silverado 1500.</p><p>Nathan has also launched a website to sell merchandise like the hoodie he was wearing in the video.</p><p>In total, not including the NFT sale which has not occurred as of this writing, Nathan Apodaca has made an estimated $200,000 from donations, merchandise sales, sponsorships and gifts off his vial TikTok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC6wK2fmqZdmbyos8Wamp5lkaW8pa3CmmSsmamoerTAxK%2BgnmWenrCsv4yiqmaooprDprrToqWgZZSnsqK50madq6edYq%2Bmtc2gZKKmk6HCpbHDZqCnZZ6bwW6%2FwKWcaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
