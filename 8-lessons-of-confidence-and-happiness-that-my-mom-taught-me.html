But beyond the flowers, cards and gifts, it’s a day that reminds us of the lasting impact they have on shaping who we are and the values that are important to us.</p><p id=eaBm7g2nBnZ data-wc=26>To celebrate, we asked some inspiring women to share the lessons their mom’s taught them and the ones that had a profound impact on their lives.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Feeling happy in your skin</h2><p id=ekEn0fm4xP9 data-wc=100>“My mother, the most wildly talented person I will ever know, taught me about confidence without even knowing the lessons were happening. Her hair, long while I was growing up, was effortlessly tied back with a scarf because she cared more about what was in her head than on it. Her figure, still slim now in her eighties, wasn’t a focus because she was always on the move. And her smile was bright because she had smart things to say. My mother wordlessly showed me how to be confident and happy in my skin – and I’m grateful every day.”</p><p id=eT6Mzygkw13 data-wc=13><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">llana Raia</a>, Founder and CEO of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Être</a>, the powerful mentorship programme for girls</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd07cacd9ac3-cropped-headshot-illana-1.jpg><h2 data-gid=eoWrnrwCC6HM dir=ltr>Kindness always</h2><p id=ejQtSbjtG2P data-wc=28>"My mother always taught me from a young girl to be kind and show empathy to others. &nbsp;She has always led by example and I love her dearly."</p><p id=etqQ_PR1Ll4 data-wc=17><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Samara Daly</a>, Co-Founder and Board Chair of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Let’s Talk Menopause</a>, the non-profit organization raising awareness about menopause.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Showing up prepared</h2><p id=eCNbp_VQdqoV data-wc=90>“I can still feel my mom's firm hand on my shoulders – pulling them back and telling me to put my chin up. My mom would make me practice giving speeches in first grade, while everyone else could use note cards in class – I had to memorize the remarks. I look up to my mom for many things in my life. A big thing that I owe her is instilling self confidence by always showing up prepared and acting like you deserve to be there – wherever 'there' is.”</p><p id=e5TV_ye6x0F5 data-wc=21><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Danielle Weisberg</a>, Co-founder and Co-CEO of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">theSkimm</a>, a digital media company giving women the information they need to make confident decisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/74c715819c0a-danielle-weisbergheadshot.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Accepting and learning from failure</h2><p id=eCxNZKZJudGn data-wc=61>“My mom taught me that building self confidence is getting good at accepting failure, but not letting it define you. Growing up, I found it odd that we would talk about failures so casually, so light-heartedly. I realized when I got older, that talking about and accepting failures is a great way to get better and grow stronger.

I learned the most not from just her words, but from watching her actions, and seeing how she valued herself and prioritized her health. She always looked within for validation, not from others, which in turn helped me build a level of self confidence and inner focus from a young age that helped me navigate competitive environments and eventually, become a female entrepreneur in a male-dominated industry.”</p><p id=e99xAMqfre1W data-wc=16><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Loren Castle</a>, Founder & CEO of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sweet Loren’s</a>, the #1 natural cookie dough brand in America.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dffefcdfefe9-tnix3510.jpg><h2 data-gid=eBbZNTz2Tnw dir=ltr>You are enough</h2><p id=eWEU5eEI59C data-wc=114>"I would say that my mother impacted me in a number of ways before she died. One she told me always to hold your friends close and then at the end of your life if you have five of them, you were a blessed person. I never forgot that and it always helps me remember that friends are cherished. And the second lesson that she left me with was, “you are enough”, and it was something that she said often that I never really understood until I got older. I know that I draw a lot of confidence from that and I go back to it often when I’m feeling those not enough days!</p><p id=eBC3bpZmPfS data-wc=12><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tamsen Fadal</a>, journalist, author and <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Let’s Talk Menopause</a> Board Member & Ambassador</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9670fad2041a-tamsan-with-fan.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Avoid negative talk</h2><p id=ekqFV-33aNFR data-wc=75>“My mom championed the power of South Asian traditions that connect me to my roots and promote mindfulness. Rituals like speech fasting, where one refrains from negative speech for a period of time, and morning walks in the sunrise, have taught me the value of inner peace and harmony. From her, I learned that prioritizing these practices helps me maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle, allowing me to face life's challenges with resilience and grace.”</p><p id=eB3YwhQL7I7o data-wc=22><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Neha Kumar</a>, Co-Founder & COO of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Full Glass Wine Company</a>, a brand acquisition and management firm focused on rapidly acquiring Direct-to-Consumer wine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14aef08a25f1-img2541-enhanced-nr.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Caring for your body inside and out</h2><p id=eq50eQ9EFIG- data-wc=87>“As a child I watched my mother in awe as she navigated a busy professional career while raising two daughters. She instilled in me the importance of taking care of your body from the inside out by always cooking healthy, balanced meals and prioritizing a great night of sleep. As a leader and a mom, I know that when I'm taking care of myself and taking the proper steps to nourish myself from the inside out I feel the happiest and show up as my best self.”</p><p id=e1ICTw4LHFkD data-wc=18><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ariel Kaye</a>, Founder of <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Parachute</a>, a brand that makes bedding and bath essentials for a more comfortable home.&nbsp;</p><p id=eyy5LqAJ9co1 data-wc=12>Here's to all the moms!
