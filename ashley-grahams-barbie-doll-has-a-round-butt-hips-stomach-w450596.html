Now, the model is rounding off the year with two big honors at once: revealing her Barbie doll and accepting her <i>Glamour </i>Woman of the Year award in Los Angeles on Monday, November 14. Get all the details on Graham’s exciting day and glitzy night in today’s Red Carpet Daily, presented by DirecTV.</p><p>On the red carpet, Graham looked blingtastic in a white halter-neck Galia Lahav Haute Couture jumpsuit with a keyhole chest cutout and sheer pantlegs. The entire number, with its off-the-shoulder straps, was made of crystals. For even more shine, Graham wore&nbsp;Arzano diamond cluster <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> and carried a black embellished Jimmy Choo clutch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ashley-graham-aea33b4b-2360-4e61-abb1-d58acbdede18.jpg><p>Graham, who’s all about body positivity and even donated a workout session and photo shoot to <a href=#>eBay for Charity</a>, wanted to make sure that the iconic doll in her likeness possessed the same confidence that she does IRL. “I’m just so honored that Mattel even thought that my message even mattered enough to ask me to be a part of an iconic brand.&nbsp;She looks like me,” Graham exclusively told <i>Us Weekly</i>. “She’s got a round butt, she’s got round hips, she’s got a round stomach and arms and she’s got my moles and my eyelashes. They actually come out of her face. It’s crazy!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/barbie-ed68e914-b2e6-4fca-885d-9286e938d1a9.jpg><p>Even though the Barbie doll is technically a toy, the figurine also holds an important message about body image. “As a kid, I was never comparing myself to all different dolls,” Graham continued. “I think I was comparing myself to humans. But I think that if I had a Barbie that looked like me, I beg to ask the question, would my body image be different today? And I think that with the younger generation, their body image will be different because they’re actually looking at somebody that looks like them. I feel like now we all are Barbie.”</p><p>Keep tuning in to Red Carpet Daily for more looks of the night from <b>Gwen Stefani</b>, <b>Zendaya</b> and <b>Chanel Iman</b>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Wardrobe: H&M)</i></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5bAqbjEsmSgqpGdrq6%2FjJuYq5qZmnqlu8ulZKGZo2Kubr7OrqWdZZKqwbV5x6KnrGWjqbyurcKhZLBsZWWCeoKO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
