While chatting with <strong>Us Weekly</strong> at the Men’s Fitness Game Changers event in West Hollywood, Calif., on Thursday, Sept. 24, Teller admitted he couldn’t eat much of anything to get his seriously ripped bod.</p><p>“You can’t eat anything that you want. You have to be very — I just kind of locked myself away,” the actor told<strong> Us</strong>. “Like I remember Halloween was the only night I drank really in like 8 months. I didn’t eat bread for 7 months. You have to just stay committed. You’re playing a professional boxer. It’s embarrassing if you’re not in good shape. I just didn’t want to be embarrassed by not putting in the work physically.”&nbsp;<img decoding=async width=467 height=263 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Miles Teller Body Selfie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Teller, who told <strong>Us</strong> he started out weighing 188 pounds with 18 percent body fat, dropped down to 168 pounds and had an impressive 6 percent body fat by the time his transformation was complete.</p><p>“It takes a long time to transform your body,” Teller told <strong>Us</strong>. “I thought that you start doing some crunches, you get abs. It’s like no, man, you gotta totally change your body’s chemistry…but I always love when actors do an accent or change their bodyweight so I was excited for the opportunity.”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Someone who wasn’t exactly stoked about his new diet and exercise regimen was his girlfriend, <strong>Keleigh Sperry</strong>. “He was ripped and shriveled, but he was also boring. He wouldn’t drink,” Sperry told <strong>Us</strong>, laughing.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Teller’s strict diet even caused a fight between the two lovebirds, dating since July 2013. “One time, I came home and I was in the middle of my training…and there’s french fries — she had just ordered this burger or something. And I got so pissed off!” Teller told<strong> Us</strong>. “I was like, ‘Baby, you cannot be eating this crap in front of me! It’s torture!’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKSipJWoerWxy6Wcq2WUnrGvwIyemK1lkqeyorCMnamipptis7C%2BjHFkpqeeqbW0edOoZKCdpGK%2FqrzPnptmamBmgnOBmA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
