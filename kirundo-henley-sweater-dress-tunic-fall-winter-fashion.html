Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, September 3, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">This dress</a> is pull-on style. Yes, there are buttons, but they’re purely decorative to give you that timeless henley look. They reach halfway down the chest and form a curved V in the otherwise round neckline. This neckline is ribbed, matching both the cuffs and the hem, which hits above the knees. A long sweater dress might feel a little warm and heavy, but this length is just right, and it leaves room for cute tights or tall boots!</p><p>This length is also exactly perfect if you want to wear this piece over leggings or even jeans. It can totally pass as a tunic, but it won’t be questioned as a dress — it’s a master of versatility!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kirundo-henley-sweater-dress-red.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KIRUNDO 2020 Winter Long Sleeve Henley Sweater Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$18</a> at Amazon!

Another feature that stands out is the sleeves, boasting a little extra volume than you’d expect to create a casual bishop sleeve look you can emphasize if you push the cuffs farther up your arms!</p><p>When it comes to getting dressed, you can already see that it will be no problem. This is going to be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">your ultimate go-to</a> for the fall and winter seasons and even into chilly spring days and nights. All you need is a pair of shoes. Boom: chic and easy outfit. Add on some black tights if you need an extra layer, or go for that cute sock-and-sneaker combo. It really is that simple!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KIRUNDO 2020 Winter Long Sleeve Henley Sweater Dress</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$18</a> at Amazon!
