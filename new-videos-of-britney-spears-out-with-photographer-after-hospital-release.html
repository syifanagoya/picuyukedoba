Somehow <a href=#>CelebTV.com</a> has two “exclusive” videos of Britney out with Adnan Ghalib, the photographer she hooked up with after she left the hospital, and it sounds like there’s just one photographer taking shots, which are sure to be worth a mint.</p><p>Ghalib was said to have tried to sell photos of Britney as well as his story of how they met for $5 million, but he has so far been unsuccessful. He will probably have much more luck making money with these latest exclusive photos and videos, which are set to air on Extra! tonight.</p><p>Britney out getting Starbucks with Adnan in Santa Barbara<br><br></p><p>Britney on a hotel balcony wearing a shirt and no pants, sharing a lollipop with Adnan<br></p><p>This guy seems like he’s using Britney, but do you think she cares? He’s giving her some much-needed attention and she often tips of paparazzi as to her whereabouts. It’s not like she’s trying too hard to hide out if she’s out getting Starbucks and leaving the curtains to her room open. If Ghalib is being kind her to and hanging out with her that’s probably all that matters to Britney. It’s likely she’s aware that he tipped at least one photographer off on where to find them and maybe he’s even giving her a cut of the profits. At least these videos show that she’s doing relatively ok.</p><p>The Sun today reports that Ghalib is <a href=#>a smooth talking Englishman</a> who was raised in a family of practicing Muslims near Birmingham. He left the UK over ten years ago to pursue a career in the states. Ghalib is married but is said to be currently separated from his wife.</p><p>Britney has so far rejected pleas by her family to get treatment in a mental health facility, which is thought to be her only chance of regaining custody rights for her children. It could be true that she tested negative for illegal drugs as Life and Style originally reported. <a href=#>People</a> confirms that her drug test came back negative.</p><p>via <a href=#>ONTD</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWxkZ3yvsdaYraKclaTAoLvFmJmroaSjsrqr0qmcmqqjlLy2wL6woK2gj6W1sMDOoKmaqJiav6Ctxa2cq5eYpMCxtdOao5iqlaGyor%2FEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
