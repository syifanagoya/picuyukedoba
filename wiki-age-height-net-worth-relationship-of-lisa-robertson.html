Despite the fact that he is 11 years her junior, they first connected when he worked close to QVC and had been dating for more than three years. Her mother reportedly passed away from ovarian cancer.</p><p>Lisa is a violinist with classical training who also sings, and has performed in front of an audience, notably at Carnegie Hall. She visits around 20 different nations in her free time to get a better understanding of their cultures. She likes to shop and experiment with new foods.</p><h2><span id=Lisa_Robertson8217s_Occupational_Life>Lisa Robertson’s Occupational Life</span></h2><p>After completing her education, she searched for a career that matched her interests, but one of her first positions was in Knoxville with a brand-new home shopping channel that was being developed from scratch.</p><p>Since the channel’s debut, she has worked with a small staff. Her time there piqued her interest in presenting, and in 1990 she was hired as a representative by the Pearl Association of America & Japan.</p><p>She also dabbled in pageantry and was crowned Miss Tennessee. This work with the “Drug-Free Tennessee” campaign led to her receiving recognition for her exceptional service from the state governor. She soon received a job as a QVC host.</p><p>QVC, or Quality Value Convenience, is a shopping channel network that specializes in televised home shopping. It was established by Joseph Segel in 1986 and is owned by the Qurate Retail Group.</p><p>From its headquarters in West Chester, Pennsylvania, it broadcasts to seven different countries, reaching an estimated 350 million households, according to reports.</p><p>Robertson would work as one of the channel’s presenters over the ensuing 20 years, showcasing and promoting a range of its for-sale goods. Her fame increased as one of the QVC faces.</p><h2><span id=Career_Information>Career Information</span></h2><p>In addition, Lisa was given the chance to host other programs, such as “Friday Night,” “PM Style,” and as a guest on “The Wendy Williams Show,” which she gladly accepted.</p><p>Along with starting her own company, GILI, which sells a variety of fashion accessories as well as home décor, she has also made guest appearances on “Good Morning America” and “Project Runway All-Stars” and experimented with acting.</p><p>After 20 years working for QVC, Lisa quit the company in 2014. Her exit reason was kept a secret. Her followers and viewers, many of whom had appreciated her presentations, responded angrily to this.</p><p>She was terrified when it was reported that she had been stalked while working at QVC, according to many sources. Peter Ferreira, one of her stalkers, was allegedly well-known for bothering her for more than ten years before being caught and imprisoned.</p><p>When she went, rumors started to spread that she had passed away, but it was later discovered that the person who had passed away only had the same name as her. Later, she herself refuted every death report.</p><p>Since quitting the organization, Lisa has dedicated her time to addressing social concerns in public speeches and in interviews with well-known media outlets including “USA Today” and “Vogue.” She continues to be in charge of her clothing line.</p><h2><span id=Social_media>Social media</span></h2><p>Lisa Robertson has accounts on numerous websites and is quite active online, just like many other television personalities.
