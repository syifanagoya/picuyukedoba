He is well-known for his appearance in the TLC reality shows Little People and Big World with his family.</p><p>Matt was born on October 7, 1961, in San Francisco, California. Diastrophic dysplasia, a kind of degenerative dwarfism, affects Roloff. He required fifteen procedures as a child due to his illness. He was born to Peggy and Ron Roloff, both of whom are of average height, although Matt is barely 1.27m tall. He has a sister, Ruth, and a brother, Sam, both of whom have diastrophic dysplasia and use crutches. Joshua, his 34-year-old brother, died of serious cardiac difficulties in 1999.</p><p>In the late 1980s, Roloff worked in Silicon Valley as a computer programmer. He later sold software products to a number of Fortune 500 companies. However, he reversed his decision and accepted a lower-paying position in order to escape the high-pressure environment of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Matt bought land in Oregon and worked diligently to build Roloff Farm, which is now available to the public.</p><p>On the show Little People, Big World, he served as an executive producer. It was a six-season triumph. TLC then joined them for a four-hour special. The series has two spin-offs: Little People Big World: Conquering Mt.
