Radar reported yesterday that Gabriel had withdrawn his custody filing, the one that started this whole mess, and sources connected with the drama say that Halle and Gabriel are now speaking to each other and taking their drama down a notch. <a href=#>Halle met with the judge yesterday</a>, and the results of that closed-door meeting are mixed. The short-term custodial issue has been resolved, it seems. Gabriel didn’t want Halle to take Nahla to New York, where Halle wanted to film a small part in New Year’s Eve. It would have been a week-long working trip, and <a href=#>Gabriel was asking the judge why Halle couldn’t simply leave Nahla in LA, with him</a>. Halle apparently even offered to put Gabriel up in a NYC hotel for the duration of the trip, so he could be with Nahla. But, the judge ruled that Halle could take Nahla out of state.</p><p>Halle’s lawyer Neal Hersh <a href=#>told TMZ</a>: “We are pleased the judge took the time to deal with this very imminent and important issue. The judge read a great deal of paperwork and gave us time to argue. Halle is very pleased with the judge’s order.” TMZ is also declaring “victory” for Halle in this particular battle.</p><p>However, <a href=#>Radar is still Team Aubry</a>. They report that Gabe will be going to NYC with Halle and Nahla, and that the judge ruled that Gabriel should be granted visitation rights. So, the judge apparently stipulated that “the actress must allow her ex-boyfriend to spend time with his daughter while she is there.” Also, the judge dismissed the child custody and support petition filed by Gabriel.</p><p>So, what does this mean? I think it means that they both kind of got what they wanted – Halle gets to travel with Nahla and work wherever she wants, but Gabriel’s visitation rights are solidified. But this is all just a temporary solution – I’m sure there’s more to come. I hope Gabriel made enough tapes of Halle’s crazy.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fp_3456348_berry_aubry_sam_02_05.jpg alt=fp_3456348_berry_aubry_sam_02_05 title=fp_3456348_berry_aubry_sam_02_05 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fp_6287235_berryhalle_nahlashop_mac_22_22.jpg alt=fp_6287235_berryhalle_nahlashop_mac_22_22 title=fp_6287235_berryhalle_nahlashop_mac_22_22 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmamxhaYBxe8eao6Wdj5eys77YmJ6rmZ6psqWr06GcmKqZnLW1q9Oolq2Zm5qsr63HpZiYp6WprLCyvqyrmqyVlK%2B2wL6woKWkj5yuo77InqOYnp%2BhubDDjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
