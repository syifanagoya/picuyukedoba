Sky was presented with the new belt by Page and Lambert in the ring on the May 27 Rampage, but the trio was interrupted by Sammy Guevara, Tay Conti, and Frankie Kazarian, who appeared on the big screen ... but they weren't in Las Vegas.</p><p>Guevara, Conti, and Kazarian were at the Florida headquarters of Dan Lambert's American Top Team. “Hanging out with you guys for one day, and I’m already committing breaking and entering,” Kazarian joked in the footage. They then smashed up Lambert's trophy (belt?) cabinets and removed some MMA title belts contained within.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>There May Be A Silver Lining To AEW's Constant TNT Title Changes</a></span></p><p>Guevara took the BMF Championship while Conti messed around with a UFC belt. The antics in Florida enraged Sky, Page, and Lambert, who finally relented and decided to accept Guevara's Double Or Nothing challenge. After the segment, the match was made official: Men of the Year & Paige Van Zant will compete against Kazarian, Guevara, and Conti in mixed trios action. If Guevara’s team loses, neither Guevara nor Kazarian will be allowed to challenge for the TNT Championship ever again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sky won the TNT Championship from Guevara on the April 27 edition of AEW Dynamite. <a href=#>Guevara won the championship</a> from Sky just 11 days prior to losing it, making him a two-time champ. <a href=#>Guevara became TNT Champion</a> for the first time when he ended the 141-day reign of "God's Favorite Champion" Miro in the main event of the <a href=#>September 29 edition of AEW Dynamite</a>. Guevara's fist reign wasn't as long as it probably should have been, but he was a fighting champion throughout, picking up wins over the likes of <a href=#>Jay Lethal</a> and Tony Nese on his journey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmejmLyzvMioZKyjqWKwtr%2FTqKRmrJ6perW106WcZpqVocFuuMCknKurXZi8rbvRrGSanadiv6K5z5qenmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
