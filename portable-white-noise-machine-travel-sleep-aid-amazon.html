It is the perfect small size to use for travel and I cannot sleep in a hotel without a sound machine. I charged it up with the USB and used for two nights all night and it kept the charge. There are multiple sound options and the volume all worked great. Added bonus of the nightlight.” Another reviewer raved, “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Perfect travel sound machine</a>.
