In case you didn’t know, Little Mix have had huge global success with two top ten albums in the US, even breaking the Spice Girls record when their album DNA debuted at number 4 on Billboard. Not to mention that in the UK, their latest single ‘Black Magic’ was number 1 on the Official Chart for three consecutive weeks and is still currently in the top 5.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the question of how Perrie was doing was asked by James as the 22 year old Geordie singer has recently became a single lady after&nbsp;Zayn Malik shockingly decided to&nbsp;end their engagement just a few weeks ago. In James Corden style, James pulled Perrie in for a comforting hug and without addressing anything particularly at the former One Direction star, asked how Perrie was doing and she replied with “do you know what, I’m good. We are having an absolute blast in America, things are going so well and I just wake up everyday and I thank my lucky stars I have these three girls.” It’s probably a topic that the girls don’t want to be addressed or highlighted in an interview but tackling tough subjects with stars&nbsp;is definitely something that James Corden knows how to handle in a great way.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/little-mix-on-late-late-show-03-320x190.jpg alt="LITTLE MIX ON LATE LATE SHOW 3" width=529 height=378 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We’re so glad that Perrie is doing well and has the girls behind her. For anyone a break up is hard to deal with but in the public eye with such an intense spotlight, we can’t imagine how much harder that must be. So we salute Pez for being so strong throughout this entire Little Mix promotion run.</p><p>The girls then performed their smash hit single ‘Black Magic’ for The Late Late show audience and put on another incredible show. These women just absolutely kill it every time and we are just so so proud of everything they have achieved. Keep smashing it girls!</p><p>Jade, Jesy, Leigh-Anne and Perrie will appear on the Today show this Wednesday, August 19th, which also happens to be the girls four year anniversary together as a band. They will be doing an anniversary live stream to celebrate the occasion with the fans which starts at 11am EST/4pm BST.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLKnkeiyxu0</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kuarA06WcZqWZrXqwuoylmK2dXaGutbGMrJ%2Bor18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
