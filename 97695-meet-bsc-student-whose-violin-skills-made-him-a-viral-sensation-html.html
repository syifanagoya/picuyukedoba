While it is his latest offerings that his followers are gushing over, Seabela has now been playing the violin instrument for quite some time.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike other musical instruments such as piano and keyboard, the violin is not that popular among the black South African musicians and the general public at large, something which the 19-year-old avows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9b6166db6839e926.jpg><p class=align-left>He told <strong>We</strong>:</p>“I always wanted to learn how to play the piano, but then during that time the orchestra group was not teaching any member the piano.“Seeing that, I then decided to try my hand at the violin as it had a nice sound. I wasn't comfortable with it in the beginning since it was something new and unusual to me”.<p class=align-left>For his part, Seabela only learned to play the violin when he first joined the <a href=#>Limpopo</a> Youth Orchestra in 2009.</p><p class=align-left>Even more, Seabela performed at Thobela FM in 2012, before performing at a wedding event at Meropa Casino in 2018. Furthermore, he performed at the wedding proposal at Jack Botes Park in January as well as at Capricorn FM last month.</p><p class=align-left>On casual days, he can be found next to VF (Getrude Shope) residence for seniors at the University of Limpopo going about his <a href=#>business</a> as usual.</p><p class=align-left>Inspired by his former teacher, Neo Thekiso together with a score of other famous violinists such as Meredith Ezinma, Mapy and Dominique Hammons, the second-year BSc in Molecular and Life Sciences student only hopes to get better and better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/45f769d0716f4403.jpg><p class=align-left>Meanwhile,<strong> We</strong> earlier reported the social media scene is taken by surprise by a video of a <a href=#>funny father who is keeping South Africans in stitches</a> as some refer to him as an exciting man.</p><p class=align-left>This comes after a social media post shared by @Mraja02 whose latest offering depicts a man who is at a party and hitting the dance floor.</p><p class=align-left>According to @Mraja02, he says this is his father as the caption suggests, "Guys this is my dad," and the image has left South Africans in love and sharing their views on the picture.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
