When Hussein El Shahat attempted to score, Abdelmounaim Boutoil tried to clear it, and it almost sailed past Williams, who could not save the shot. Luckily, the ball struck the crossbar, denying Al-Ahly a goal. Their defence going forward kept Al-Ahly at bay.</p><h2>Rival football fans praise Sundowns</h2><p class=align-left>Fans from other <a href=#>football clubs</a> in Mzansi on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> gave credit where it was due.</p><p class=align-left>Senzo Mazibuko said:</p>“Wel done, Masandawana.
